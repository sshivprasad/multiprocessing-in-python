# Multiprocessing in Python

#### The code is in reference to the post https://sangrha.wordpress.com/2021/05/10/multiprocessing-in-python/

The demo module contains example calls to map(), map_async(), apply(), apply_async(), imap(), imap_unordered() to demonstrate the usage.
The preprocess_text module contains code to get a comparative measure of time taken by pandas map, map_async, imap, imap_unordered to preprocess about 2200 texts by removing emoticons, punctuations, stopwords etc.
